                <p> In short, Saber Tooth Tiger is a prehistoric carnivorous mammal, with distinctive pair of long razor-sharp canine teeth, that got extinct at the end of the Ice Age some 10,000 years ago. It is very popular among prehistoric animals due to its fascinating looks and its elongated sword-shaped canine teeth.

                <p> The lion (Panthera leo) has been disappearing from the wild at a rapid rate. In the last 21 years, equivalent to just three lion generations, their population has plummeted by an estimated 43%. Today, lions are extinct in 26 African countries with less than an estimated 30,000 wild lions remaining. In short - they are in serious trouble across the African continent. Learn more here about lion conservation and the different issues they face in the countries that they still range in Africa.

            <div class="card-desc">
                <p>The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large felid species and the only living member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides. With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. Its powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain.
